    <h2>I LOVE MUSIC</h2>
    
    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/8dmd47f252duz4sz0ktsvcksi?si=52bdb2383d0a4164" target="_blank">My Spotify :)</a>
    
    <p> Music has always been my greatest source of comfort. It has the unique power to stir emotions, heal heavy hearts, and bring a sense of peace. I can’t go a day without it, it’s the rhythm of my life. I love diving into different genres, discovering new sounds, and learning the stories behind the artists who create them. If I had been blessed with the ability to sing, I know my path would look entirely different. Music helps me think, process, and truly feel. It lifts me when I’m down, soothes my anxiety, and fuels my motivation when I need it most. It’s a universal language that speaks to each of us in our own way, and that’s what makes it so extraordinary. Without music, life would feel dull and incomplete. For me, music isn’t just a pastime, it’s therapy.</p>
