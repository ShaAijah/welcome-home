        <p>Music has always been something that I have seen as comforting. It has the power to both evoke emotion and soothe heavy feelings. I cannot go a day without almost constanly listen to music. I love exploring different generes and hearing about artists stories. If God gave me the ability to sing I would absolutely be going down a different career path.  Music helps me think, process, and feel. It comfots me when im sad, calms me when im anxious, it gives me energy when I need motivation. It's a collection of sounds that is like a universal language that speaks to us all, but in different ways and that's what makes it so beautiful. Without music life would be colorless and bland. Music is my therapy. </p>
